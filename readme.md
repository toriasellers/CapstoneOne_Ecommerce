Capstone 1: E-commerce

About the Project:
This is a fake website for worms on a string. You can buy worms on a string and buy worms off a string (note the legal disclaimer).

About the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap:
Instead of using a lot of Bootstrap I did most of the styling myself. Something I struggled with (and probably forever will lol!) is positioning in CSS. Initially, when I had my positions set to absolutes and used float, my browser wouldn't recognize that as content on the page resulting in repeats of my linear gradients in the background. To resolve this, I removed those positions for it to be considered as "content" and span the page as you descend downwards.
